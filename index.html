	<p style="background-color:rgb(50, 131, 168);padding:10px;font-family: Arial">A dosai or dosa or dose is a thin pancake or crepe, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance, although savoury flavours are generally emphasized (sweet variants also exist). Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in South Indian cuisine, but now have become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and sambar in recent times. Other accompaniments include chutney powder (a fine groundnut and lentil powder).</p>

	<p style="background-color:rgb(50, 96, 168);font-family: Arial;">What does dosa taste like exactly? As described, it's a thin, crisp crepe or pancake. It has a slight tangy taste due to the fermentation, and is savory rather than sweet. Without the filling, on its own it's called 'plain dosa' that can be eaten with a variety of vegetable curries</p>
	<h1><center>What to eat it with</center></h1><hr color="blue" size=10 width=75%>
	<p style="background-color:rgb(50, 62, 168);font-family: Arial;">Traditionally, dosa is served with a bowl of sambar and coconut chutney on the side. Some darshinis also serve a spicy tomato chutney along with the other accompaniments.</p>

	<p style="background-color:rgb(64, 50, 168);font-family: Arial">Since Dosa is typically a street food, it's easy to take and eat on the go. In fact, it's customary in the Indian culture to eat Dosa with your hands! I like to tear it off and eat it in small bites. ... If it's served with chutney, you can use a knife to spread some over your Dosa and eat it bit by bit.</p>
<h1><center>Why I like it</center></h1><hr color="blue" size=10 width=75%;>
<p style="background-color:rgb(83, 50, 168);font-family: Arial;">Dosa is famous for its simple ingredients, interesting flavors, and even its sweet aroma. I love it for how easy and clean the ingredients are. It can be eaten as a snack, as breakfast, or really anytime you're in the mood! Originating in southern India, Dosa has been around since the 5th century AD.></p>
